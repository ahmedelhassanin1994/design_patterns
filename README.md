# Observer Design Pattern : 
* is a behavioral pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes, typically by calling one of their methods.


Use Cases:
* Real-time data updates (e.g., news apps, stock prices).
* Event systems in GUIs.
* Notifications for state changes.

# Strategy Design Pattern : 
is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

Use Cases:
* Payment processing with multiple methods.
* Sorting with different algorithms.
* Validation with interchangeable rules.


# Abstract Factory Design Pattern : 
is a creational pattern that provides a way to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which objects to instantiate.

Use Cases:
* Building UI libraries for multiple platforms (e.g., macOS, Windows).
* Managing families of related objects.
