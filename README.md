# Observer Design Pattern : 
* is a behavioral pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes, typically by calling one of their methods.


Use Cases:
* Real-time data updates (e.g., news apps, stock prices).
* Event systems in GUIs.
* Notifications for state changes.

# Strategy Design Pattern : 
is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

Use Cases:
* Payment processing with multiple methods.
* Sorting with different algorithms.
* Validation with interchangeable rules.
